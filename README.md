# Sentiment-Analysis

# Project Explanation

   # Data Simulation: We simulate user feedback with labels indicating positive (1) or negative (0) sentiment.
   # Text Preprocessing: Basic preprocessing is applied to clean the text.
   # Feature Engineering: We use TF-IDF vectorization, which captures the importance of words in the feedback.
   # Model Development: A RandomForestClassifier is used, which is robust and provides feature importance insights.
   # Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
   # Interpretability: SHAP values help in understanding which features (words/phrases) influence the predictions.
   # Prediction Function: A simple function predicts the sentiment of new user feedback.
